Working title: Noise-Robust Sign-Restricted SVARs

Manuscript slug: noise-robust-sign-restricted-svars

KnowledgeVault link: `../knowledge-vault-link.json`

Current stage: first figure-led drafting pass started, then M0034 exposed a
scale-normalization error in the M0030/M37 diagonal-anchor robust-DW object.
The abstract, introduction, evidence section, M28/M29 validation, and M37
audit still describe the now-superseded six-moment diagonal-anchor statistic
and must be revised before further polished Section 2-4 drafting.

Current focus: inspect the M0034 pure higher-cumulant Figure 1 variant and
decide whether the paper's constructive object is the pure robust-DW set, a
validly scaled second-moment-plus-cumulant set, or a narrower diagnostic
claim.

Next recommended action: run M39, the post-scale-correction rebuild task,
before M38. Do not draft Section 4 from the M0030/M37 diagonal-anchor
estimator.

Active milestone: M0034, pure robust Figure 1.

Active blockers:

- The M0030/M37 diagonal-anchor robust-DW estimator is superseded. With
  `diag(B)=1`, the off-diagonal covariance equation is
  `Sigma_u,12=b21*sigma_1^2+b12*sigma_2^2`, not `b12+b21`, unless unit shock
  variances are imposed as an extra scale normalization. The active robust-DW
  fallback is the pure five-moment higher-cumulant stack.
- The M25 standard-DW J-test inversion result is only a working derivation; M28
  supports the high-noise divergence story, but the derivation still needs a
  direct audit before theorem-level prose.
- The M30 audit found that the original M35 moderate-noise scenario was near a
  structural-coordinate rescaling exception. The patched screen now includes
  an anisotropic diagonal-noise stress case, but the provisional
  scale-normalized finite-sample statistic is still too permissive for final
  evidence.
- The intuitive sign/DW/robust-DW evidence is no longer settled. M0034 rendered
  `fig_sign_dw_pure_robust_noise_grid.png`; in the high-noise column the pure
  robust row contains true `B0` but accepts about 0.459 of the full plotted
  grid, showing the expected loss of precision after dropping invalid
  second-order information.
- The robust-DW simulation code must be wrapped under `manuscript/replication/`
  before the paper is shareable.
- The first figure-led skeleton now uses the refreshed M29 chi-square rows as
  draft-level evidence and reserves repeated/bootstrap rows for
  robustness-audit language. Final publication replication should still move
  the code into `manuscript/replication/` and can rerun a heavier table if
  needed.

Last substantive session: 2026-06-06, opened M0034 after the user identified
the scale error in the diagonal-anchor moment. Generated the pure
higher-cumulant Figure 1 variant and marked the prior diagonal-anchor evidence
as superseded pending a valid rebuild.

Last maintenance session: 2026-06-05, cleared the stale M21 task state after
verifying the M0005 transparency snapshot and GitHub milestone closure.

## Do Not Forget

- Keep this manuscript repository self-contained for sharing.
- Keep the model simultaneous and impact-only; do not introduce VAR lags or
  dynamic impulse-response machinery in the first paper.
- Keep each substantive work block traceable through `transparency/`, Git
  commits, and milestone tags.
- Keep KnowledgeVault links explicit in working notes, not hidden in prose.
- One paper should carry one central idea.
- The first version is theory/simulation only; no application for now.
- Treat the robust DW route as a candidate theorem until audit and simulations
  support it.
- Every non-original claim needs a source trail or citation.
- Every original contribution should be marked as such in prose or provenance.
- Final figures, tables, and replication outputs should be reproducible from
  `replication/`.
