Working title: Noise-Robust Sign-Restricted SVARs

Manuscript slug: noise-robust-sign-restricted-svars

KnowledgeVault link: `../knowledge-vault-link.json`

Current stage: figure-led evidence planning after the M0020-corrected noise
and non-Gaussianity grid pair.

Current focus: treat the M0020 grid pair as the paper's visual spine and run
the validation needed before turning it into final manuscript evidence.

Next recommended action: start M28 validation of the grid pair: population
moments, repeated seeds, grid-boundary sensitivity, robust-DW truth inclusion,
standard-DW truth rejection under noise, and weak-moment widening.

Active milestone: none. M0021 records the user decision that the M0020 grid
pair tells the paper's main story and should organize the next plan.

Active blockers:

- The robust DW derivation passed M24 only as a local normalized
  Gaussian-noise result; it still needs population-grid checks before becoming
  final manuscript evidence.
- The M25 standard-DW J-test inversion result is only a working derivation; it
  still needs audit and population-grid triage.
- The M30 audit found that the original M35 moderate-noise scenario was near a
  structural-coordinate rescaling exception. The patched screen now includes
  an anisotropic diagonal-noise stress case, but the provisional
  scale-normalized finite-sample statistic is still too permissive for final
  evidence.
- The intuitive sign/DW/robust-DW evidence now has a selected M0020 visual
  spine. All rows invert pointwise 10 percent J tests; the robust-DW rows use
  higher-cumulant restrictions only. The figures are strong enough to organize
  the paper, but not final enough to skip M28/M29 validation.
- The robust-DW simulation code must be wrapped under `manuscript/replication/`
  before the paper is shareable.
- A figure-led section draft should wait until the M28 validation confirms the
  grid-pair story is stable enough to avoid another structural rewrite.

Last substantive session: 2026-06-06, promoted the M0020 grid pair to the
paper's visual spine and reordered the next tasks around validating and
quantifying that story.

Last maintenance session: 2026-06-05, cleared the stale M21 task state after
verifying the M0005 transparency snapshot and GitHub milestone closure.

## Do Not Forget

- Keep this manuscript repository self-contained for sharing.
- Keep the model simultaneous and impact-only; do not introduce VAR lags or
  dynamic impulse-response machinery in the first paper.
- Keep each substantive work block traceable through `transparency/`, Git
  commits, and milestone tags.
- Keep KnowledgeVault links explicit in working notes, not hidden in prose.
- One paper should carry one central idea.
- The first version is theory/simulation only; no application for now.
- Treat the robust DW route as a candidate theorem until audit and simulations
  support it.
- Every non-original claim needs a source trail or citation.
- Every original contribution should be marked as such in prose or provenance.
- Final figures, tables, and replication outputs should be reproducible from
  `replication/`.
